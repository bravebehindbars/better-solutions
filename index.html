	<h1>Better Solutions for the Formerly Incarcerated</h1>
	<p>Two of the main reasons that inmates return to prison are lack of employment and lack of funds upon release. I have learned this mainly from personal experience and observation over approxmately 20 years of incarceration. Getting released is a very tough transition for a number of inmates. That in and of itself can be extremely stressful and then you pile lack of funds and a lack of the structure that comes with unemployment to it and the pressure can creep up on formerly incarcerated people pretty fast. I believe we can attack both issues at once with more vocational courses on welding in prisons and outside of prisons for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people. I believe this will help cut our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/recidivism.html">recidivism</a> rates down even more. There has been a shortage of welders in the United States for several years and the AWS(American Welding Society) estimates that the <a href="https://weldingworkforcedata.com/">shortage</a> is only growing. </p>

	<h2>MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
	<p>Our mission is to create a chain of welding fabrication companies that specialize in buidling metal structures like homes, workshops and sheds etc. The business will also offer welding courses in all processes. All in the vicinity of correctional facilities. The goal is to connect with residents immediately after release and either continue their training if they have done some on the inside or start them from the beginning if they have no experience. After they have completed the basic courses to be able to safely fabricate metal buildings we will employ them to start building metal building homes as soon as possible. While employed at our company employees will be able to continue training with more courses in any process they choose if that is what they are driven to do. Maybe metal building homes is not what some of the them are looking to do for a long term goal. We will teach them any specialized welding process to prepare them for the sector of the industry they are interested in and also attempt to place them in a job. I strongly believe if we connect with formerly incarcerated people as soon as possible after they are released from prison that we will be able to give these residents a significantly better chance at a successful return to society and even a successful long term future.</p>
