Two of the main reasons that inmates return to prison are lack of employment and lack of funds. I have learned this from personal experience in my life. Getting released is a very tough transition for a number of inmates. That in and of itself can be extremely stressful and then you stack lack of funds and a lack of the structure that comes with employment. The pressure can creep up on people pretty quickly. If we can target these two issues with the vocational teaching of welding classes in prisons, I believe we can cut our recidivism rates even more. There has been a shortage of welders in the United States for several years and the AWS(American Welding Society)estimates that the shortage is only growing.
